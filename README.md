As a senior analyst who is tasked with conducting a crucial animal study for potential skin cancer treatments, my purpose is to study the 249 mice and their reactions to various drug treatments. The analysis is organized into tasks such as: DATA PREPARATION, SUMMARY STATISTICS, DATA VISUALIZATION, OUTLIER IDENTIFICATION, AND REGRESSION/COEFFICIENT ANALYSIS. To conclude, the purpose of these tasks is to further extract relevant insights/analyze these treatments for skin cancer by first testing on mice. 

1.) Data Preparation

2.) Generate Summary Statistics

3.) Create Bar Charts/Pie Charts

4.) Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create Box Plot 

5.) Create Line/Scatter Plot

6.) Calculate Correlation/Regression
